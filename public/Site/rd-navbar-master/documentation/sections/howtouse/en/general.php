<h3>
    Principles of working with the script
</h3>

<p>
    There may be absolutely any HTML layout for the creation of navigation. Everything depends solely on the template’s design and fantasy of the coder. However, all the navigation elements should be located inside the block with the class .rd-navbar
</p>

<code>
<pre>
&lt;!-- RD Navbar --&gt;
&lt;nav class="rd-navbar"&gt;
    ...
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;!-- END RD Navbar--&gt;
</pre>
</code>

<p>
    The principle of working with navbar is based on the usage of various layouts. The demo, for example, shows how one and the same markup looks on the mobile (.rd-navbar-fixed) and desktop (.rd-navbar-static) layouts. The titles of layouts can also be completely diverse, and up to the developer.
</p>

<p>
    In general, the realization of any navigation in the template using RD Navbar is reduced to using the following functional units of the script:
</p>

<ul class="marked-list">
    <li>
        Adjustment of navbar’s layouts for the appropriate resolutions
    </li>
    <li>
        Sticky panel setting
    </li>
    <li>
        Navigation setting: dropdown and megamenus.
    </li>
    <li>
        Setting switches (toggles)
    </li>
    <li>
        Linker Adjustment
    </li>
    <li>
        Single page navigation adjustment
    </li>
</ul>
