## Concept
First of all, you need to remember. RD Navbar - is a navigation builder. It provides all functionality that you need to
create your own unique navigation.

## Map of classes
There are several classes that you can use for your navigation creation:

* .rd-navbar - Base class for nav creation. Wrap all your nav with ``<nav class="rd-navbar"/>``;
* .rd-navbar-dropdown - Use this class as a wrapper for your dropdown menus;
* .rd-navbar-megamenu - Use this class as a wrapper for your megamenus;
* [data-rd-navbar-toggle] - Use this data-attribute with any kind of buttons or links to create your custom
toggles.

## Setup
The HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes are always unique for your target navigation. So check out our extended documentation for additional instructions: [Documentation](http://cms.devoffice.com/coding-dev/rd-navbar/documentation/)
